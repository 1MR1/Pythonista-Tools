Pythonista Tools
================

Our goal is to become a one stop shop for looking for [Pythonista](http://omz-software.com/pythonista/) scripts. No more scouring through GitHub Repos and Gists to find scripts, they're all here.

Request a Repo/Script
------------

Don't see a repo/script on here? [Open a new issue](https://github.com/Pythonista-Tools/Pythonista-Tools/issues/new?title=Please+add+this+link+to+Pythonista-Tools&body=URL:+) with the name and url of the program you'd like added and we'll be sure to get on it ASAP. Also, please be sure to add the proper labels to your issue. It helps us and in return will get it on Pythonista Tools quicker.

Questions on how to download scripts?
------------

Pythonista Tools is currently just a collection of links to different projects made in Pythonista, so if there is something you want to download, go to its link and follow the instructions the project itself provides. If no instructions can be found at the projectâ€™s homepage, try asking about it on the [Pythonista forums](https://forum.omz-software.com).
